Raspberry Milky Way: There is a dust cloud near the center of our Milky Way galaxy that smells like rum and tastes like raspberries. The cloud consists largely of ethyl formate which is known to give rasberries their taste and rum it's distinctive smell. ----- Fire and Ice Planet : A solar system called Gliese supports a planet made almost entirely out of ice - at 439 degrees Celsius. It is basically a huge ice cube that's constantly on fire. The only reason the ice stays solid is because of the amount of water present on the planet and the gravity, which keeps all of the water molecules so densely packed that they cannot evaporate. ----- Diamond Planet : There is a planet in the Cancri solar system that is twice as big as Earth and has eight times it's mass, making it a 'Super-Earth'. One third of the mass of the planet is said to be pure diamond, which was created when the planet's carbon core was exposed to heat and pressure. The planet would be priced at 26.9 nonillian dollars if we could set it in a ring. ----- Planets on Planets : We have eight planets in our solar system but there are thousands of other planets in space. So far we have confirmed almost 1800 other planets and have identified 3000 others that are awaiting confirmation! ----- Us in the sun : The sun makes up 99.8 percent of the entire mass of our solar system. It would take one million earths to create a mass of similar size.
